-----**Context**------
```
We are going to develop a Employee Management application using Angular JS.

What is Employee Management application? - Every organization has a employee management application/portal to manage employee information(eg; adding new hire details, updating existing employee information, deleting the employee information when they leave the org)

I have Installed NodeJS and Angular CLI in my Mac, and created a skeleton(draft) project for Employee Management(Angular Based).
